Lunatic depends on the following:

* LuaJIT 2.0.3 or later [http://luajit.org]. It is recommended to get the
  latest git HEAD of the 2.0 branch. As of time of writing, LuaJIT 2.1 is
  in alpha, and has not been successfully tested with Lunatic.

* LPeg 0.12 [http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg].

For Windows, static libraries and headers have been provided.

See platform/Windows/lib/instructions.txt for information on building.

Build EDuke32 with the GNU Make invocation "make LUNATIC=1".
