		<h1>Release Notes for JFDuke3D</h1>
		<p>Release date: 9 October 2005</p>

		<h2>New Features and Improvements</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Improved stability with mods, particularly Duke Meets Doom which no longer crashes when you
			punch a wall for instance. Big thanks to Richard "TerminX" Gobeille for his help with identifying
			the cause of this problem and fixing it.</li>
			<li>MD3 models may now have a skin for each surface of the model. If you don't know what this
			means, don't worry. If you do, then you ought to realise the significance of this.</li>
			<li>Polymost high-resolution texture and model skin caching has been made far more comprehensive.
			This has the effect of reducing the number of pauses during gameplay when textures are loaded at
			the expense of a longer wait during the level load phase while the textures and skins are loaded
			from disk.</li>
			<li>Individual user profile support. See <a href="#profiles">this section</a> for more
			information.</li>
		</ul>
			
		<h2>Known Issues</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>You may have instances where the game goes out of sync. The master can often restart the game
			from the menu without everyone having to restart the game from scratch, and things should be
			fine.</li>
			<li>A test version in the near future will include my new sound code that supports OggVorbis and
			other sound formats. For now, the existing AudioLib code is in use.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3><a name="profiles">Individual User Profiles</a></h3>

		<p>With Windows 2000 and XP, having multiple user accounts for different people on the one computer has
		been very easy, with XP especially so. Linux, BSD, and other *nix-like OS users have had this ability
		forever and now JFDuke3D properly supports installations where each user can have his/her own set of
		configuration and savegame files without interfering with other players on the same PC. On Windows the
		default mode of behaviour is the same as in previous versions: everything is shared, but it is now possible
		to enable "user profile mode". Linux/BSD users will run in "user profile mode" permanently; your personal
		files will be located in <code>~/.jfduke3d</code> so if you used previous versions of the port, you will
		have to move your config and savegames there. Windows users can turn on "user profile mode" by creating an
		empty file in the JFDuke3D directory named 'user_profiles_enabled'. Here is how:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>In Windows Explorer, navigate to the JFDuke3D directory.</li>
			<li>Open the File menu, move to the "New" option, and select "Text Document".</li>
			<li>Type <code>user_profiles_enabled</code> and press Enter.</li>
			<li>If a dialog box appears asking to confirm changing the filename extension to one that may
			make the file unusable, choose "Yes".</li>
		</ol>
		<p>When you next run JFDuke3D, a JFDuke3D directory will be created in <code>C:\Documents and
		Settings\<em>your username</em>\Application Data</code> along with a new configuration file. You will
		then have to move your existing DUKE3D.CFG file to this location if you have used the game previously.</p>
		
		<h3><a name="multiplayer">Multiplayer games</a></h3>

		<p>Multiplayer games are started via command-line parameters passed to DUKE3D.EXE. This is a short guide
		to getting a multiplayer game running between these three hypothetical computers:</p>
		<table class="center" border="1" rules="groups" cellpadding="2">
			<colgroup><col /></colgroup>
			<thead>
				<tr><th>Host name</th><th>IP address</th></tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr><td>faye</td><td>192.168.1.2</td></tr>
				<tr><td>asuka</td><td>192.168.1.5</td></tr>
				<tr><td>kaoru</td><td>192.168.1.6</td></tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<p><span class="warning">Keep in mind that the networking features are still being refined and there are
		certain issues and caveats to be aware of when using it.</span> The basic syntax of the network command
		line is like so: <code>DUKE3D <em>(normal game parameters)</em> /net <em>(network parameters)</em></code></p>
		<table border="1" rules="cols" cellpadding="2" class="center">
			<caption>Network parameters</caption>
			<colgroup>
				<col valign="top" />
			</colgroup>
			<tr>
				<td>/nx:y</td>
				<td>Game comm type. <em>x</em> = 0 for master/slave or 1 for peer-to-peer.<br />
					If unspecified, <em>y</em> defaults to 2. For more than two players in a
					master-slave game, you have to indicate the number on the <em>master</em>.
					eg: /n0 or /n0:4</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>/px</td>
				<td>Overrides the default port (23513) with <em>x</em> being the new port value.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>address:port</td>
				<td>An address of a machine. See the items below for more information.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<h4>Master/Slave mode</h4>
		<p>This mode is the easiest mode for use with Internet play since it requires only the address of the master
		of the game (the person hosting the game) be specified by each slave who joins. Here are example command
		lines each machine must run to join the game hosted by the machine named 'asuka':
		</p>
		<table border="1" rules="cols" cellpadding="2">
			<tr><td>asuka</td><td><code>DUKE3D.EXE /net /n0:3</code></td></tr>
			<tr><td>faye</td><td><code>DUKE3D.EXE /net /n0 192.168.1.5</code></td></tr>
			<tr><td>kaoru</td><td><code>DUKE3D.EXE /net /n0 192.168.1.5</code></td></tr>
		</table>

		<h4>Peer-to-peer mode</h4>
		<p>This mode is often useful for playing on a LAN where it is easier to coordinate and organise the order of
		peers in the game. This mode will become simpler to set up in the future but for now this is how to do
		it. Peer-to-peer mode requires each machine specify the addresses of each other machine in the game in the
		same order, but indicating its own position in the sequence with the <code>/n1</code> option.</p>
		<table border="1" rules="cols" cellpadding="2">
			<tr><td>asuka</td><td><code>DUKE3D.EXE /net /n1 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.6</code></td></tr>
			<tr><td>faye</td><td><code>DUKE3D.EXE /net 192.168.1.5 /n1 192.168.1.6</code></td></tr>
			<tr><td>kaoru</td><td><code>DUKE3D.EXE /net 192.168.1.5 192.168.1.2 /n1</code></td></tr>
		</table>

		<h4>Addresses and ports</h4>
		<p>The networking code is capable of resolving WINS host names (on Windows) and DNS names to their
		corresponding addresses, so if your network is configured with such services, instead of having to specify
		raw IP addresses, you can give the computer's WINS host name or a DNS host name.</p>
		<p>The default port the game communicates on is 23513. Some users may find it necessary to set up a
		forward through their Internet firewall in order to get games working when playing across the Internet.
		You can override the default port via the <code>/p<em>???</em></code> switch where <em>???</em> is the new
		port number. If a master is running a game on a port other than the default, the slaves will have to
		specify the alternative port with <code>address:port</code> notation, eg. 192.168.1.5:20000</p>

		<h3><a name="md2sprite">3D Models</a></h3>

		<p>Polymost uses the Quake II MD2 and Quake III MD3 format for 3D models. You can replace any wall-aligned or
		face sprite in the game with a 3D model using a declaration in the DUKE3D.DEF file. For more information
		on the specifics of the DEF-file commands for 3D models, <a href="#deffile">see here</a>.</p>
		<p>Included in this release is a model of the Pig Cop by Parkar, and the skin by Motionblur. You should
		visit <a href="http://www.planetduke.com/hrp/">this site</a> for a much larger pack of
		textures and models. I shall use this model to demonstrate how to replace the Pig Cop character in Duke.</p>

		<p>Here is the definition for the pig cop which is also included in the sample DUKE3D.DEF file.</p>
<pre>
   //New syntax:
model "models/pigcop.md2"
{
   scale 1.30 shade 0
   skin { pal 0 file "models/pigcop.jpg" }
   anim { frame0 "walk0" frame1 "walk13" fps 20 flags 0 }
   frame { name "walk0" tile0 2000 tile1 2019 }

   anim { frame0 "pump0" frame1 "pump2" fps 10 flags 1 }
   frame { name "pump0" tile0 2025 tile1 2027 }

   frame { name "stand" tile0 2030 tile1 2034 }

   anim { frame0 "shoot0" frame1 "shoot2" fps 10 flags 1 }
   frame { name "shoot0" tile0 2035 tile1 2037 }

   anim { frame0 "dive0" frame1 "dive3" fps 8 flags 1 }
   frame { name "dive0" tile0 2040 tile1 2044 }
   frame { name "dive3" tile0 2045 tile1 2049 }

   anim { frame0 "dshoot0" frame1 "dshoot2" fps 10 flags 1 }
   frame { name "dshoot0" tile0 2050 tile1 2052 }

   frame { name "die0" tile 2055 }
   anim { frame0 "die1" frame1 "dead" fps 13 flags 1 }
   frame { name "die1" tile0 2056 tile1 2059 }
   frame { name "dead" tile 2060 }
}


   //Old syntax:
definemodel "models/pigcop.md2" 1.30 0
definemodelskin 0 "models/pigcop.jpg"

definemodelanim "walk0" "walk13" 20 0
definemodelframe "walk0" 2000 2019

definemodelanim "pump0" "pump2" 10 1
definemodelframe "pump0" 2025 2027

definemodelframe "stand" 2030 2034

definemodelanim "shoot0" "shoot2" 10 1
definemodelframe "shoot0" 2035 2037

definemodelanim "dive0" "dive3" 8 1
definemodelframe "dive0" 2040 2044
definemodelframe "dive3" 2045 2049

definemodelanim "dshoot0" "dshoot2" 10 1
definemodelframe "dshoot0" 2050 2052

definemodelframe "die0" 2055 2055
definemodelanim "die1" "dead" 13 1
definemodelframe "die1" 2056 2059
definemodelframe "dead" 2060 2060</pre>
		<p>Without going through every line of the example, here is the basis of how the definitions work.
		You must put a
		definemodel line before any other definemodelframe or definemodelanim lines. The frame and anim lines
		refer the the definemodel line which precedes them. You can define frames and animations in any order, ie.
		the animations do not need to be given before the frames, but it is a good convention to keep them
		together for clarity.</p>
		<p>The walking loop for the pig cop spans tiles 2000 to 2019. The model contains a fourteen frame walking
		animation which we play at 20 frames per second. The first line of the example specifies the
		"models/pigcop.md2" model should be drawn at 1.3 times its normal scale and be left undarkened or
		lightened. The definemodelskin line specifies the skin to use for palette 0 for all the definemodelframe
		lines that follow it. The first of the definemodelanim lines declares the fourteen frame walking animation
		at 20fps which should loop (the 0 for the flags parameter says to loop). The definemodelframe line which
		follows it maps the ART tiles from 2000 through to 2019 to play the walking animation. Because the name in
		the definemodelframe line matches the first frame of the definemodelanim line, the animation will
		automatically play.</p>

		<h2><a name="deffile">DEF-file Language</a></h2>

		<p>Documentation of the DEF file language can now be found on <a
			href="http://jonof.edgenetwork.org/?p=jfbuild.def">my website</a> as the information there is
		common to all JFBuild-based ports.</p>

		<h2><a name="maphack">Map Hack scripts</a></h2>

		<p>"Map Hack" scripts are files that override certain aspects of a map file when it is rendered in OpenGL
		Polymost mode. Currently they allow for angle adjustment on sprites, and the ability to prevent particular
		sprites from being drawn as a model. These are useful for making small corrections to ornamental sprites in
		a way that doesn't require modifying the original map.</p>
		<p>The game will automatically load a map hack script whenever a map is loaded. The script should have the
		same base name as the original .MAP file, but with an .MHK extension. The map hack language is described
		below. It uses the same parser as DEF files, so you can use comments in the same way.</p>

		<dl>
			<dt>sprite <em>number</em></dt>
			<dd>Begins a sprite definition. <em>number</em> is the sprite number to affect. You can find this in
			the Build editor by highlighting the sprite in 2D mode and pressing Control+Tab. The next group of
			commands describe the changes to make to the sprite.
			<dl>
				<dt>notmd<br />
				notmd2<br />
				notmd3</dt>
				<dd>Prevents the sprite from being drawn as a model. It gets drawn as a regular sprite
				instead. <strong>notmd2</strong> and <strong>notmd3</strong> are synonyms for
				<strong>notmd</strong>.</dd>

				<dt>nomdanim<br />
				nomd2anim<br />
				nomd3anim</dt>
				<dd>Prevents model animation from playing if the sprite is being drawn as a model.
				<strong>nomd2anim</strong> and <strong>nomd3anim</strong> are synonyms for
				<strong>nomdanim</strong>.</dd>

				<dt>angleoff <em>angle</em><br />
				angoff <em>angle</em></dt>
				<dd>Adds <em>angle</em> to the angle of the sprite just before it is rendered. This is good
				for fixing up things like toilet sprites that are facing the wrong way.
				<strong>angoff</strong> is a synonym for <strong>angleoff</strong>.</dd>
			</dl></dd>
		</dl>

		<p>Here is an example map hack script:</p>
<pre>// Map hack file for JFDuke3D
// Level: E1L2.MAP (Original Atomic Edition version)
// Prepared by jonof@edgenetwork.org

// Invisible switch behind hand dryer in toilet of porn shop
sprite 191 notmd2

// Invisible switches on telephones near billiards room in club
sprite 254 notmd2
sprite 517 notmd2

// Toilet in restroom in club
sprite 478 angoff -512</pre>

		<h2><a name="hightile">Hightile</a></h2>

		<p>This release features the "Hightile" texturing improvements to Polymost. Hightile allows Polymost to use
		true-colour textures instead of the artwork in the game's usual .ART file.</p>
		<p>Replacement textures can be saved as JPEG, PNG (alpha channel supported), TGA, BMP, CEL, GIF, and PCX
		formats. Hightile uses Ken Silverman's picture library to provide rapid picture file loading.</p>
		<p>Hightile textures are defined in the DUKE3D.DEF file. See the <a href="#deffile">DEF-file language</a>
		reference for information on how to specify Hightile textures.</p>
		
		<h3>Limitations to Hightile</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Hightile will squash or stretch the replacement to fit in the dimensions of the original tile
			it replaces. Artists should keep their replacements in the same ratio as the original tile for the
			art to not look distorted.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2><a name="hightile-zip">ZIP file support</a></h2>

		<p>Duke (and Build games in general) can load game resources from a ZIP file.</p>
		<p>ZIP files are used in Duke in the same manner as extra GRP files are specified. Use the "/g" command-line
		switch to specify the ZIP to load. eg. <code>DUKE3D.EXE /gMYFILE.ZIP</code></p>

		<h2><a name="polymost">Polymost</a></h2>

		<p>Polymost is a full 3D implementation of the Build engine renderer, with hardware acceleration capability,
		and perspective in six degrees of freedom. In Ken's own words (copied from POLYMOST.C in my Build engine
		source distribution):</p>
		<pre>
"POLYMOST" code written by Ken Silverman
Ken Silverman's official web site: http://www.advsys.net/ken

Motivation:
When 3D Realms released the Duke Nukem 3D source code, I thought somebody would do a OpenGL or
Direct3D port. Well, after a few months passed, I saw no sign of somebody working on a true
hardware-accelerated port of Build, just people saying it wasn't possible. Eventually, I realized
the only way this was going to happen was for me to do it myself. First, I needed to port Build to
Windows. I could have done it myself, but instead I thought I'd ask my Australian buddy, Jonathon
Fowler, if he would upgrade his Windows port to my favorite compiler (MSVC) - which he did. Once
that was done, I was ready to start the "POLYMOST" project.

About:
This source file is basically a complete rewrite of the entire rendering part of the Build engine.
There are small pieces in ENGINE.C to activate this code, and other minor hacks in other source
files, but most of it is in here. If you're looking for polymost-related code in the other source
files, you should find most of them by searching for either "polymost" or "rendmode". Speaking of
rendmode, there are now 4 rendering modes in Build:

    rendmode 0: The original code I wrote from 1993-1997
    rendmode 1: Solid-color rendering: my debug code before I did texture mapping
    rendmode 2: Software rendering before I started the OpenGL code (Note: this is just a quick
                hack to make testing easier - it's not optimized to my usual standards!)
    rendmode 3: The OpenGL code

The original Build engine did hidden surface removal by using a vertical span buffer on the tops
and bottoms of walls. This worked nice back in the day, but it it's not suitable for a polygon
engine. So I decided to write a brand new hidden surface removal algorithm - using the same idea
as the original Build - but one that worked with vectors instead of already rasterized data.
		</pre>
		<p>Polymost is the default renderer choice for any video mode with a colour depth greater than 256
		colours.</p>
		<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If your computer does not have an OpenGL graphics card, Polymost in OpenGL mode
		will most likely use the default Windows OpenGL rasterising facility which does all rendering in software.
		This may be extremely slow. If your Windows installation doesn't have any form of OpenGL rendering ability,
		Polymost will probably crash.</p>
		<p><strong>NOTE 2:</strong> OpenGL Polymost has been tested on an nVidia Riva TNT 16MB, an nVidia GeForce2
		GTS 32MB, an nVidia GeForce4 Ti4600 128MB, an nVidia GeForce 6800GT 256MB, an ATi Radeon Mobility 9000 64MB,
		and a 3D-Labs Oxygen GVX420 128MB (minor texturing issues).</p>

		<h2>Console Commands</h2>

		<p>This is a list of console commands and variables and their purpose:</p>

		<dl>
			<dt>changelevel &lt;episode&gt; &lt;level&gt;</dt>
			<dd>Warps to a new level.</dd>
			
			<dt>dumpbuildinfo</dt>
			<dd>Displays the compilation information for the game when it was built.</dd>

			<dt>echo &lt;text...&gt;</dt>

			To avoid the menu bug, run the game in fullscreen mode and type "glredbluemode 1" AFTER
			beginning the game. Sorry, there is no way to change parallax or separation. Do not contact
			us about bugs with this mode... if you do, we'll think twice about documenting hidden features

			<dd>Sets the OpenGL anisotropic filtering level.</dd>

			<dt>gltexturemode &lt;mode-number&gt;</dt>
			<dd>Sets the OpenGL texturing mode. Valid values are:

			<dd>Same as typing "DNCOORDS" cheat.</dd>

			<dt>showfps &lt;0 or 1&gt;</dt>
			<dd>Shows/hides the framerate counter. Same as typing "DNRATE" cheat.</dd>

			<dt>spawn &lt;tile-number or name&gt; [pal] [cstat] [angle] [x y z]</dt>
			<dd>Places a sprite of the given tile number or name at the current position, or if given, the "x

			<dt>usegoodalpha &lt;0 or 1&gt;</dt>
			<dd>If 1, a lower alpha cutoff value is used when rendering textures with transparency, which
