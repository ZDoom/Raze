# Welcome to Raze!

[![Build Status](https://github.com/coelckers/Raze/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)](https://github.com/coelckers/Raze/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Continuous+Integration%22)

## Raze is a fork of Build engine games backed by GZDoom tech and combines Duke Nukem 3D, Blood, Redneck Rampage, Shadow Warrior and Exhumed/Powerslave in a single package. It is also capable of playing Nam and WW2 GI.

The game modules are based on the following sources:

  * Duke Nukem: JFDuke, EDuke 2.0, World Tour extensions from DukeGDX and some minor fixes from EDuke32.
  * Redneck Rampage: Nuke.YKT's reconstructed source available in the Rednukem Git repo.
  * Blood: NBlood.
  * Shadow Warrior: SWP and VoidSW.
  * Exhumed/Powerslave: PCExhumed, with some enhancements inspired by PowerslaveGDX.
